# PS7_Velocity_Profiling

Justin Beiriger, jwb153


The code in this repo demonstrates the smooth braking trajectory of the robot when the E-stop is initiated. The machine in Olin was not allowing me to find the topic to which the mobot in Gazebo was publishing its LIDAR information, so I tested the code on the STDR instead. I was able to get good results, and I will use this to command Jinx in our lab assignment this week.
